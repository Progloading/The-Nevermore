## <<< Quick Comprehension>>>

This project demonstrates the evolution of securing sensitive data operations in a Java-based application. It begins with a deliberately vulnerable implementation with minimal security that performs basic insert, update, delete, and query functions on a database. Through a series of progressive stages (4â€“5 parts), I apply security best practices including input sanitization, encryption, authentication, and access control. The goal is to highlight common vulnerabilities and showcase how to properly secure a software system handling sensitive information. Security is life. 



## Folder Structure

The workspace contains 4 folders by to begin with, where:

- `vscode`: the folder to maintain setting configurations, which customizes folder structure
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Including, compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Parts to explore

- Hash
- multi-classes
- encryption
- ...
